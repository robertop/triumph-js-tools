Triumph JS Tools
----------------
This project is a set of command-line tools that work with the Triumph IDE
in order support JavaScript development. In particular, this project
contains command line scripts that parse JavaScript files and
store function declarations into a SQLite file.  This resulting SQLite
file is then used by Triumph during auto-completion for JavaScript files.


Project setup
-------------

```
    npm install
```
